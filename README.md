In this box of digital delights, you'll find:

A GameController that calls the shots like a boss.
The LogParserService that knows the Quake log like the back of its cybernetic hand.
A ReportService so good at reporting, it makes Walter Cronkite look like an amateur.
The models directory, where Game and Player classes reside like royalty in their digital throne room.
