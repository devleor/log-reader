<h1>Quake Log Parser Extravaganza! 🕹️👾</h1>


Welcome, fellow gamer and code wrangler, to the most thrilling adventure in the land of log parsing! This is not your everyday log parser; it's a Quake Log Parser that eats log files for breakfast and spits out game stats with a side of player rankings!

Dive into the abyss of game logs and emerge victorious with organized data that would make even the Strogg pause and nod in respect. 🤖

What's in the Box?
In this box of digital delights, you'll find:

A `GameController` that calls the shots like a boss.
The `LogParserService` that knows the Quake log like the back of its cybernetic hand.<br>
A `ReportService` so good at reporting, it makes Walter Cronkite look like an amateur.<br>
The `models directory`, where Game and Player classes reside like royalty in their digital throne room.<br>
Tests? We've got 'em. We test like it's a sport, and we're going for gold! 🏅Pre-reqs: What You'll Need

<h2>Before you jump in, make sure you've got:</h2>

Node.js installed (the Node alchemists recommend the latest stable version).
A love for the command line, for it is your wand in this magical realm.
The spirit of a gamer, ready to type out incantations (commands) with precision and speed.
Running the Show
To kick things off, navigate to your project's mystical directory and conjure up the server with the ancient spell:

```bash
node src/index.js
```
This incantation initializes the sacred GameController which orchestrates the parsing symphony.

Testing Your Mettle (and Code)
Ah, brave soul, you wish to test your code as well? Fear not! For Jest, the guardian of the code, stands ready to assist. Make sure Jest is installed in your repository by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```
Then, with a flourish of your keyboard, run:

```bash
npm test
```
Watch as Jest leaps into action, running tests with the ferocity of a Death Knight!

Need to Test a Specific Scroll?
If you're feeling adventurous and wish to test just one ancient scroll, execute:

```bash
npx jest path/to/your/test/file.test.js
```
Replace path/to/your/test/file.test.js with the path to the test file that holds
